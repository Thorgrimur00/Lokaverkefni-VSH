<p>Doom is a sci-fi horror fps (first person shooter), released in 1993 and developed by ID software (John Romero, John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, Tom Hall) in 1992-1993</p>
			<h1>Plot</h1>
			<p>The player takes the role of an unnamed space marine ("Doomguy") who has been punitively posted to Mars after assaulting his commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire on
			   civilians. The Martian space marine base acts as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation, a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with
			   teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. Mars is considered by space marines to be the dullest assignment imaginable. This all
			   changes when the UAC experiments go horribly wrong. Computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely, and "something fragging evil" starts pouring out of
			   the gateway, killing or possessing all UAC personnel. Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent by ship from
			   Mars to Phobos to investigate, where the player character is left to guard the perimeter with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside. The marine hears assorted
			   radio messages, gunfire, and screams, followed by silence: "Seems your buddies are dead." The player cannot navigate the ship off of Phobos alone and sees that the only way out is
			   to fight through the Phobos complex.
			<h1>Release</h1>
			<p>Doom was released by ID software through their shareware model popularised by Apogee software (later 3D realms), in which a portion of the game, usually as 1 episode of several, is released
			   free to download and the rest is avialable for purchase. When Doom originally released, it featured a free free episode, called Knee-deep in the dead, and two aditional episodes
			   available through purchase called "The Shores Of Hell" and "Inferno". An expansion called "The Ultimate Doom" was released in 1995, and added a fourth and much harder episode
			   called "Thy Flesh Consumed".</p>
